# Testing
This project uses [`tytanic`](https://tingerrr.github.io/tytanic/index.html) to
run tests (currently just checking that output documents match a reference image
to prevent regressions).

To run tests, you'll need to obtain `tytanic` and then run
```
just test
```

When making changes that intentionally change the output, run
```
just update
```
to update the reference files.
